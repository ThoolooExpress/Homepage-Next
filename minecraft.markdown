I'm currently running a modded Minecraft server for people that I know. You'd
like to play Minecraft with me:

1) Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/bvPkJnAhhB) and ask to be whitelisted.
2) Install FTB Revelations via the [FTB App](https://feed-the-beast.com) or
   [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/).
3) Point your client at `mc.thoolooexpress.com`.

Do beware that when I stop running the server there's a 77% chance I forget
about this page, so don't be too surprised if none of the links work.
