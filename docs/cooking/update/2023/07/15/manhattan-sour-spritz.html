    <p>Earlier today I was kinda hot from making the critical mistake of walking around
in New York in the summer, so naturally the first thing I wanted to do when I
got home was get my buzz on. Normally I’d reach for a light beer, but all I had
in my fridge was Leffe, so I had to improvise. I’d left a bottle of Wild Turkey
front and center on my liquor cart, and instantly both a Manhattan and a Whiskey
sour were front and center on my mind.<!--more-->However, I wanted something at
least a little hydrating, so I got the wonderful idea to mix most of the
ingredients from both together and spritz it up a bit.</p>

<h2 id="wtf-is-this-a-cooking-blog-now">WTF, is this a cooking blog now?</h2>

<p>Given how little I post, I wouldn’t call this an <em>anything</em> blog. It’s just
where I ramble about whatever’s on my mind every few months or so. I do intend
to make a bit more cooking / cocktail content at some point, but notice the
distinct lack of a lengthy backstory or photos on this post—I plan on
keeping anything culinary-adjacent strictly limited to recipes and results of
experiments.</p>

<h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1.5oz Wild Turkey bourbon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1oz sweet vermouth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2tbsp granulated sugar (or 3-tips of one of those controlled-pour sugar
server thingies, I didn’t actually measure)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1tbsp fresh lemon juice (or however much comes out of 1/2 a lemon, I didn’t
actually measure)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seltzer water (prefer SodaStream or other highly-carbonated water; if you
use something like S. Pellegrino that’s actually pleasant to drink plain,
the final drink will be under-carbonated)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bitters</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare the glass: Add a few cubes of ice to a 12-oz glass (I used the
conical Ikea ones that are ribbed for your pleasure. I have no idea what that
kind of glass is actually called, it’s kind of like the “shaker pint” bad
bars serve draft beers in but 12oz instead of 16.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the vermouth to the bottom of the glass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shake the bourbon, sugar and lemon juice very hard. (Don’t worry too much if
there’s a little bit of sugar left in the bottom of the shaker; I sure as
hell didn’t.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strain the contents of the shaker gently into the glass, taking care to
maintain a bit of a “sunrise” effect with the sweet vermouth, if you actually
care about that kind of stuff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Top with seltzer, and carefully incorporate the shaken ingredients with the
seltzer with a bar spoon, taking care to avoid disturbing the layer of sweet
vermouth on the bottom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dribble some bitters on top in whatever artful pattern suits your fancy (but
it better be a dick.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forget to take a picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decide not having pictures in your posts is your thing now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make 3 more, get a bit of a buzz on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decide today is the day to revive your blog you’ve been ignoring for months.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
