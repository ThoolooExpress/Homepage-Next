    <p>Shocking, isn’t it, after a literal decade of constantly telling my friends,
imaginary and otherwise, that I figured out how to do this cool thing and that
they should do it, and then saying I’ll write a post about it one day, I’m
actually doing it. I finally made a blog! <!--more--> Only time will tell if
I’ll actually write about all the cool and pointless LaTeX tricks I’ve been
using to meet page-minimums, and all the weird and horrible stuff I do to all my
VsCode installations because I’m way too picky, or if I’ll just leave this blog
empty until I mature enough that it’s definitely embarrassing, and I delete it
completely.</p>

<p>My goals with this are to share all the weird tricks I’ve had to come up with by
splicing together multitudes of StackOverflow solutions, make myself sound at
least 3% more credible, and maybe make the 0.01% of people that like my humor
laugh.  At this point, all the post ideas I have so far are based around one or
more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How annoying C++ is sometimes</li>
  <li>LaTeX tricks designed to defeat your professor’s margin-measuring,
and allow you to turn in that 3 page paper and meet a 5 page minimum.</li>
  <li>Pointless and weird projects involving hardware I get from the trash</li>
  <li>Stuff I wish somebody had told me like 4 years ago</li>
  <li>Really low-quality Minecraft content</li>
</ul>

<p>Check back in about 5 years, maybe I’ll have remembered that this exists and
actually made another post.</p>
