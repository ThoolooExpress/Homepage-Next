figured I should close out at least one of the things I started on this blog
before I write a post about my next grand idea.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<p>Honestly, I mostly just  forgot about it. I did start off pretty strong. I
actually did uninstall the apps I said I would, and I intentionally made my
browser a pain to use through copious extensions. For a while, my overall screen
time did go down.</p>

<p>However, despite never officially giving up, I gradually chipped away at my
rules until there was essentially nothing left. First I reinstalled Instagram,
because there are still some group chats I’m in where it’s the only platform we
can all agree upon. I told myself it was only going to be for chats and gave
myself only 20 minutes on the app every day via Android’s screen time controls.
Naturally, the posts and reels I had to swipe past to get to the chats ended up
pulling me in, and I gradually had to raise my time limit so I’d have time to
message people… this cycle made me into a regular Instagram user
again.</p>

<p>A similar story played out for the other problematic apps on my phone. There is
a bit more of a story with Youtube, I may write another post about that one at
some point.</p>

<p>The browser extensions hung on quite a bit longer. I still actually block
recommended videos on Youtube on my desktop browser, and I have mostly kicked my
Reddit habit. (Although honestly, the site had been going downhill for a while.)
However, I definitely still have a few go-to sites for a “quick hit” of content
that I frequent all too often.</p>

<p>As for my goals, the only one I accomplished was finishing <em>A Crown of Swords</em>,
I actually finished the whole series, although it took almost 2 years.</p>

<p>Instead of making the <em>Reddit Liberation</em> extension work on Firefox, I ended up
just cobbling together some uBlock filters to block every part of Reddit except
for comment threads, so I could still get useful information by appending
“reddit” to my Google searches, but I couldn’t get sucked into viewing more
posts. I actually forgot to migrate my filters when I reinstalled my OS, but so
far I’ve yet to go back to regular Reddit use so I guess I’ve grown out of them.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>I am still working to reshape the role that technology plays in my life. I think
I’ve had a little bit of success in making myself less of a content junkie over
the last 2 years, but I’m not ready to write about it yet. For now, I think
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNOol5OTasw">HGModernism has said everything on the topic that I’d want
to</a>. I’ll write another post when I
feel I have something substantial to add.</p>

<p>I will say, though, Minimalist Phone (Android Only) has worked wonders. The key
advantage it has over other screen-time-controlling apps is that it makes you
decide exactly how much time you want to spend on an app before you can open it,
and then reminds you if you’ve exceeded that amount of time. This is much less
frustrating and much more powerful than daily screen time limits. I don’t think
I’m ever going to use a phone without it again.</p>]]></content><author><name>Richard Morrill</name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><category term="technology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2 years ago I gave myself a challenge… it did not go so well, but I figured I should close out at least one of the things I started on this blog before I write a post about my next grand idea.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://thoolooexpress.com/assets/logo.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://thoolooexpress.com/assets/logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Manhattan Sour Spritz; Also, Is This a Cooking Blog Now?</title><link href="https://thoolooexpress.com/cooking/update/2023/07/15/manhattan-sour-spritz.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Manhattan Sour Spritz; Also, Is This a Cooking Blog Now?" /><published>2023-07-15T07:58:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-15T07:58:00-04:00</updated><id>https://thoolooexpress.com/cooking/update/2023/07/15/manhattan-sour-spritz</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thoolooexpress.com/cooking/update/2023/07/15/manhattan-sour-spritz.html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I was kinda hot from making the critical mistake of walking around

<h2 id="wtf-is-this-a-cooking-blog-now">WTF, is this a cooking blog now?</h2>

<p>Given how little I post, I wouldn’t call this an <em>anything</em> blog. It’s just
where I ramble about whatever’s on my mind every few months or so. I do intend
to make a bit more cooking / cocktail content at some point, but notice the
distinct lack of a lengthy backstory or photos on this post—I plan on
keeping anything culinary-adjacent strictly limited to recipes and results of
experiments.</p>

<h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1.5oz Wild Turkey bourbon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1oz sweet vermouth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2tbsp granulated sugar (or 3-tips of one of those controlled-pour sugar
server thingies, I didn’t actually measure)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1tbsp fresh lemon juice (or however much comes out of 1/2 a lemon, I didn’t
actually measure)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seltzer water (prefer SodaStream or other highly-carbonated water; if you
use something like S. Pellegrino that’s actually pleasant to drink plain,
the final drink will be under-carbonated)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bitters</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare the glass: Add a few cubes of ice to a 12-oz glass (I used the
conical Ikea ones that are ribbed for your pleasure. I have no idea what that
kind of glass is actually called, it’s kind of like the “shaker pint” bad
bars serve draft beers in but 12oz instead of 16.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the vermouth to the bottom of the glass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shake the bourbon, sugar and lemon juice very hard. (Don’t worry too much if
there’s a little bit of sugar left in the bottom of the shaker; I sure as
hell didn’t.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strain the contents of the shaker gently into the glass, taking care to
maintain a bit of a “sunrise” effect with the sweet vermouth, if you actually
care about that kind of stuff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Top with seltzer, and carefully incorporate the shaken ingredients with the
seltzer with a bar spoon, taking care to avoid disturbing the layer of sweet
vermouth on the bottom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dribble some bitters on top in whatever artful pattern suits your fancy (but
it better be a dick.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forget to take a picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decide not having pictures in your posts is your thing now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make 3 more, get a bit of a buzz on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decide today is the day to revive your blog you’ve been ignoring for months.</p>
  </li>

and to do so I’ll
need to put in place some technical safeguards to keep me on track.<!--more-->
I’ll be augmenting my self control primarily via focus mode on my phone, browser
extensions, and making sure that I have a full to-do list of both recreational
activities and side projects.</p>

<h2 id="phone">Phone</h2>

<p>Eliminating time spent scrolling on my phone is really the lowest-hanginging
fruit of this entire challenge. I’ve already mostly migrated away from dedicated
mobile apps, so I’ll mostly be using the same browser extensions on Firefox
mobile as I am on desktop. However, I do use Tusky for Mastodon, so I will be
setting up a screen time limit of 30 minutes per day, and hiding every tab
besides my subscription feed. I’ll also disable notifications for everything
besides direct messages.</p>

<h2 id="browser">Browser</h2>

<p>This is where the fun begins. For me, spending a week off grid would be taking
this challenge on easy mode. If something interrupts the normal flow of my life,
such as a trip or an old friend staying with me, I can ignore pretty much all of
the electronic distractions in my life for a while and focus on the novelty of
it all. That’s not what this challenge is about, though. I want to change my
habits long-term, and for obvious reasons, never using a computer again is just
not an option for me.</p>

<p>So, what I really need to do is strike a balance between my browser being useful
to me and sucking away all my free time. Eventually, I’ll have to develop some
self control. However, until I get there, I’ll need some browser extennsions to
help me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/">LeechBlock NG</a> -
This one is the heavy hitter. I’m going to use it to restrict my access to a
huge variety of sites, and limit the total time I can spend on sites that I
consider necessary, like YouTube and Reddit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/">Unhook</a> -
This one will prevent me from using YouTube to do anything but search for specific videos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/HZ757/reddit-liberation-extension">Reddit Liberation</a> - This
one will allow me to read Reddit comments from Google searches while preventing
me from getting sucked into my feed. It’s actually Chrome only, so making it
work on Firefox will be one of my first tasks for this week. Until it works,
I’ll totally block Reddit with LeechBlock.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll also be making a conscious effort to only check my email when I actually
need to. Sometimes I find scrolling through my junk mail becomes my last-resort
content fix when I try to quit social media, so I’ll make it a bit easier to
just not do that by cleaning out my inbox now and trying to unsubscribe / block
as many mailing lists as I can.</p>

<h2 id="to-do-list">To-Do list</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(As mentioned above) Make Reddit Liberation work on Firefox, and possible
add a few minor improvements.</p>

    <p>Get good at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/">5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel</a>.</p>

week, avoid all forms of entertainment based around recommendation algorithms.
<!--more--> This is partially a follow-up to
<a href="/lifestyle/2023/01/25/boredom-tolerance.html">last week’s post</a>, but
I decided to make the rules quite a bit
stricter and shorten the time frame after reading about
<a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/cmdline-challenge.html">The One Week Command Line Challenge</a>.
(Thanks, <a href="https://defcon.social/@focaccio">@focaccio</a> for bringing that article
to my attention.)</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Originally, taking a break from algorithm-recommended content was simply a way
to break my addiction to a contant drip of spoon-fed short-form content. I
wanted to be come more okay with simply not being optimally entertained every
waking second of my life. However, the second reason given for <em>The Command Line
Challenge</em> really stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe too few of us are concerned with living productive lives. This is
not just about our productive use of technology. Many seem not to be concerned
with being productive as human beings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often am concerned with how little of my life outside of work is anything
close to productive. The article goes on to hit even closer to home:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Out of apathy, many of us are allowing ourselves to be nothing more than
worker drones with little if any individuality, intellectual curiosity, or
goals in life other than following the lemmings ahead of us in our swift race
through life that leads ultimately only to our deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realized that my media habits have a second dark side: it’s very rare that I
make an informed, independent decision about what I do with my free time. I will
spend an entire Saturday drinking from the algorithm-powered firehoses of Youtube
and Reddit and then wonder as I’m waiting to fall asleep why I didn’t choose to
write a blog post or work on any of my personal projects. Now I’ve realized that
the issue isn’t that I was <em>choosing</em> not to be productive, it’s that I wasn’t
<em>choosing</em> anything at all! I spent the entire day stuffed so full of
fresh content that there was no room left in my mind to make a conscious choice
about anything.</p>

<p>Using only a command line on my computer and disabling every non-messaging app
on my phone would definitley prevent me from binging short-form content. The
problem is that the Command Line Challenge itself just isn’t appealing to me. Don’t
get me wrong, I use a command line extensivley every day both at work and at
home, and am reasonably competent at it, but the idea of checking my email and
responding to code review comments through a terminal interface has absolutley
zero appeal to me. Some things really are best done through a GUI.</p>

<p>So, my goal here is twofold: I want to leave a little more boredom in my day and
I want to replace my habit of mindlessly consuming content with a habit of
making a conscious choice about what content I consume and how I entertain
myself.</p>

<p>I’m under no dilusion that I’ll be able to make every second of my life
productive. Some lesure time and entertainment will always be necessary.
However, I believe that if I can at least restore some real decisions to my
daily routine I’ll choose to be productive more often.</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>There really is only one rule:</p>

<p><strong>Decide what you want to do before you start doing it.</strong></p>

<p>How you choose to implement this needs to be a personal decision, because
everybody has different tastes in entertainment and different hobbies, and so
will need to implement a different set of detailed rules. Here is my plan for
living a bit more intentionally:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Block feeds and recommendations on Reddit and Youtube. Those two sites are
such indispensible repositories of useful information that totally excluding
them from my Google search results would hamper my abliity to look up how to
do anything. However, I can block the most insidious parts of both sites with
uBlock Origin. (I’ll post a follow-up with the filters I end up using.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid almost all traditional social media sites like the bird app and
Instagram altogether.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limit my use of Mastodon to my home feed. I only recently started
using Mastodon, so my follow list has not gotten too poluted. At this point
every follow has been a distinct choice that still reflects my current
preferences fairly well, so I don’t see anything wrong with reading posts
from the peolpe I’ve subscribed to. Since I don’t follow too many people yet
there are only so many posts to read every day. I will be keeping track of my
usage and consider excluding Mastodon entireley in future iterations of the
challenge if I sink too much time into it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limit my consumption of traditional broadcast TV to live sports. I think my
reasons for avoiding channel-surfing shows on traditional TV are pretty self
explanatory, but I think it’s okay to make a carve-out for sports since
the self-limiting factor of there only being so many games on I want to
watch in any given week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hide comments on <a href="https://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>. I need some tech news, and
Mastodon isn’t quite doing it for me. The articles on Slashdot’s front page
are of highly-variable quality, but there are only so many of them every day,
so it isn’t an endless content stream. The comments, however, are an
oppurtunity to doomscroll I can do without.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other subscription streaming sites.
Theoretically I could still consume from these sites without violating the
spirit of this challenge by just deciding what to watch before opening the
site / app, but I spend too  much time using them and figured this would be
a good opportunity to explore other froms of entertainment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, you can’t break habits, only form new ones. I don’t have a super
concrete plan for what I’m going to replace mindless content creation with, but
here are some of my ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Play the games that I already own. My entire Steam backlog is made up of hopeful
conscious choices that I later ignored in favor of drinking from the
algorithms’ teats for hours on end. Maybe I’ll make some progress trying out
all those forlorn indie games I’ve got kicking around. (Not too hopeful for
that one.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read the books I already own. Reasoning is the same as above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most importantly of all: <strong>create content</strong>. I’m not entireley sure
what I’ll create. Maybe it’ll be more blog posts here. Maybe I’ll write a
short story. I’ll probably make a few open source contributions as well, but
my goal here really isn’t to force myself to code outside work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re considering this challenge, you should probably include “go outside”
as part of your plan. My plan doesn’t include that because right now I can’t do
much outside as I just had knee surgery.</p>

<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>

<p>I’ll annouce the start of my personal challenge on Mastodon, post daily updates
there, and then write a conclusion article here. I want to go Monday to Sunday,
so if nothing changes, I’ll start next Monday, Febuary 6th. I’ll be using
#noalgorithmchallenge for all posts relating to this challenge, and I suggest
you do the same if you’d like to take this challenge yourself and document your
experience publicly.</p>]]></content><author><name>Richard Morrill</name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><category term="technology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am issuing a challenge to myself and anybody else who is interested: For one week, avoid all forms of entertainment based around recommendation algorithms.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://thoolooexpress.com/assets/logo.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://thoolooexpress.com/assets/logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What Happened to My Boredom Tolerance?</title><link href="https://thoolooexpress.com/lifestyle/2023/01/25/boredom-tolerance.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What Happened to My Boredom Tolerance?" /><published>2023-01-25T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-25T10:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://thoolooexpress.com/lifestyle/2023/01/25/boredom-tolerance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thoolooexpress.com/lifestyle/2023/01/25/boredom-tolerance.html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought I knew the worst week of my life. When I was in 10th grade and had
just moved to Cameroon I was alone<sup id="fnref:where-was-stepdad"><a href="#fn:where-was-stepdad" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in a mostly-empty house
while my father went to work, with no internet and no cell service. I was in a country
where I knew nobody, and in which I did not feel safe exploring alone on
foot<sup id="fnref:safe-cameroon"><a href="#fn:safe-cameroon" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. School hadn’t started yet, and I didn’t have a job. There
as simply nothing to do, and the little scraps of entertainment I was able to
find have since faded into the trauma-induced blur that hovers over that week.</p>

<p>A few years later I started having arguably worse weeks due to sickness, injury
and breakups, but even now that week in Cameroon stands out as uniquely
horrifying. For a while I was convinced that the scariest part of that week was
how nearly all of the discomfort I felt came from within, from my own inability
to not become horribly depressed in the absence of external stimulation, or to
seek out entertainment that wasn’t spoon-fed by social media algorithms. I did
have access to pen and paper, a large yard and a pool, none of which I used to
their full potential to either entertain myself or do anything remotely
self-improving.</p>

<p>The thing is, despite handling that week pretty badly, I survived. School
started, we got internet, I got a local SIM card and I mostly forgot about the
hours I spent pacing around becoming increasingly frustrated with my inability
to find anything to do. What really scares me when I think about that week now
is just how much worse it would be if I were stuck in a similar situation today.</p>

<p>Like many wanna-be sigma males my age, I’ve attempted to break my content
addiction and been both amazed and horrified by the lengths my lizard brain will
go to get its “fix.” A while back I removed all social media apps from my phone
and very quickly found myself aggressively scrolling back through promotional
emails while on the toilet. I told myself I was only going to watch
“educational” YouTube videos, and very quickly found myself drawn to endless
lists of facts that bombard the mind with far more information than it can
possibly absorb in a single sitting, even taking into account my incredible
ability to memorize obscure and useless information. There’s some part of my
brain that just needs that shotgun blast of new information, whether it
comes from thirst traps on Instagram, Reddit comments, or Youtube videos. On the
few occasions that I’ve tried to cut out the filler content cold turkey I’ve
been able to feel my mood worsening with every instance my mind has craved
content and I’ve denied it.</p>

<p>So, with this more recent experience in mind, I’m actually pretty proud of how I
handled that week in Cameroon. I was a little depressed, sure, but mostly I just
accepted the boredom as a temporary fact of life and knew I’d get through it. I
wish I could handle attempting to quit filling my empty moments with short-form
content nearly as gracefully. Despite mostly failing to do anything meaningful
that week, I do recall engaging in a few extended periods of deep thought that
ended up significantly changing how I saw myself and approached socializing in
my new school. Now when I end up with a day with nothing to do I almost always
lose it to content consumption. Sometimes I wish I could just spend a day being
bored.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:where-was-stepdad">

      <p>There is one issue with this story: my stepfather was
there as well, and was not working at that point. I honestly cannot recall

When I was in 10th grade and had just moved to Cameroon I was alone1 in a mostly-empty house while my father went to work, with no internet and no cell service. I was in a country where I knew nobody, and in which I did not feel safe exploring alone on foot2. School hadn’t started yet, and I didn’t have a job. There as simply nothing to do, and the little scraps of entertainment I was able to find have since faded into the trauma-induced blur that hovers over that week. A few years later I started having arguably worse weeks due to sickness, injury and breakups, but even now that week in Cameroon stands out as uniquely horrifying. For a while I was convinced that the scariest part of that week was how nearly all of the discomfort I felt came from within, from my own inability to not become horribly depressed in the absence of external stimulation, or to seek out entertainment that wasn’t spoon-fed by social media algorithms. I did have access to pen and paper, a large yard and a pool, none of which I used to their full potential to either entertain myself or do anything remotely self-improving. The thing is, despite handling that week pretty badly, I survived. School started, we got internet, I got a local SIM card and I mostly forgot about the hours I spent pacing around becoming increasingly frustrated with my inability to find anything to do. What really scares me when I think about that week now is just how much worse it would be if I were stuck in a similar situation today. Like many wanna-be sigma males my age, I’ve attempted to break my content addiction and been both amazed and horrified by the lengths my lizard brain will go to get its “fix.” A while back I removed all social media apps from my phone and very quickly found myself aggressively scrolling back through promotional emails while on the toilet. I told myself I was only going to watch “educational” YouTube videos, and very quickly found myself drawn to endless lists of facts that bombard the mind with far more information than it can possibly absorb in a single sitting, even taking into account my incredible ability to memorize obscure and useless information. There’s some part of my brain that just needs that shotgun blast of new information, whether it comes from thirst traps on Instagram, Reddit comments, or Youtube videos. On the few occasions that I’ve tried to cut out the filler content cold turkey I’ve been able to feel my mood worsening with every instance my mind has craved content and I’ve denied it. So, with this more recent experience in mind, I’m actually pretty proud of how I handled that week in Cameroon. I was a little depressed, sure, but mostly I just accepted the boredom as a temporary fact of life and knew I’d get through it. I wish I could handle attempting to quit filling my empty moments with short-form content nearly as gracefully. Despite mostly failing to do anything meaningful that week, I do recall engaging in a few extended periods of deep thought that ended up significantly changing how I saw myself and approached socializing in my new school. Now when I end up with a day with nothing to do I almost always lose it to content consumption. Sometimes I wish I could just spend a day being bored. There is one issue with this story: my stepfather was there as well, and was not working at that point. I honestly cannot recall whether he was there but we simply did not have much to talk about, or if he was off doing something I’ve forgotten about. He had only been married to my father for a short while at that point, and I recall that we didn’t exactly hit it off when we first started living together, so it’s possible we just ignored each other. &#8617; I want to be clear, at least when I was there from 2013 to 2016, my neighborhood, Bastos, Yaoundé was not particularly unsafe, and later on I felt perfectly safe to walk to nearby stores and friends’ houses. &#8617;]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://thoolooexpress.com/assets/logo.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://thoolooexpress.com/assets/logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">We’re Back Baby!</title><link href="https://thoolooexpress.com/update/2022/07/22/were-back-baby.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We’re Back Baby!" /><published>2022-07-22T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-22T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://thoolooexpress.com/update/2022/07/22/were-back-baby</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thoolooexpress.com/update/2022/07/22/were-back-baby.html"><![CDATA[<p>Fun fact… if you check the

real fraud.  Observe the behavior of developing-world despots for long enough
and you will see, if you can’t change the results of an election, the next best
thing is to convince everybody that they cannot trust its results.
<!--more-->It’s all too easy to get hung up on whether or not a new form of
voting like vote-by-mail, or electronic voting machines is “safe,” and overlook
the ways that a corrupt politician desperately clinging to power could convince
the public that their opponent committed election fraud.  In this post, I’m
going to briefly look at some of the issues with vote-by-mail, but my primary
focus is going to be on whether it <em>will be trusted</em> not if it <em>can be trusted</em>.
Even if you and I do our research, and decide to entrust your vote to the postal
system, if enough of the rest of the country decides they cannot, it will be
child’s play for Trump (or another politician down the line), to convince them
that their loss was fraudulent.</p>

<p>Vote-by-mail is simply not as easy to trust as a traditional in-person system.
In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI">excellent argument against online
voting</a>, Tom Scott lays out the
primary goals of any voting system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anonymity: Nobody can see how you voted, and once a ballot is cast, voters
have no way to prove who they voted for.</li>
  <li>Trust: It must be extremely difficult to create fake votes or prevent
legitimate votes from being counted, and everybody with a stake in the
election must trust the system enough to believe its results.</li>
</ul>

<p>A traditional paper ballot system accomplishes this by having every voter place
a ballot (which must not contain any individually identifiable marks) into a
tamper-evident ballot box, which is only opened for counting in the presence of
a member of every party involved in the election.  Although there are plenty of
attacks that can be made against this system, in Tom’s words they, “do not scale
well,” as almost every conceivable attack involves manipulating people, not
technology, and would need to be repeated for every opposition party
representative at every place that votes are counted.  Trust in the system is
achieved through an utter lack of trust in any individual.  At every stage, the
voter is the only person ever allowed to be alone with a ballot, and even then,
only inside the controlled environment of a voting booth.  Importantly, every
voter can readily understand why this form of security is effective.</p>

<p>When you cast a ballot by mail, however, numerous individuals, primarily in the
postal system, have time alone with your ballot to read, modify, or destroy it.
Although the final counting procedure ends up being fairly similar to in an
in-person election, how can you trust that your ballot actually made it into the
pile?  Also, what’s to stop voters from showing their ballot to others before
sending it off, thus proving who their voted for, to potentially receive a
financial reward, or to avoid threatened violence?</p>

<p>I’ve only scratched the surface of holes that can be poked in vote-by-mail. Some
of these issues can be at least partially resolved with tamper-evident
envelopes, special anonymous confirmation codes, and other band-aid solutions.
However, the issue here is largely the same one that would arise if I were to
create, using my knowledge of cryptography, a “mathematically perfect”
public-key-based voting system.  I could trust it, anybody with a background in
mathematics or computer science could trust it, but could hundreds of millions
of technophobic and poorly-educated voters trust it?  Everybody understands that
it’s hard to tamper with a box of ballots if you’re being observed from every
angle by people who are unlikely to conspire together due to their opposing
political interests.  Every change you make to the existing system invites new
theories about how it can be defrauded.  Although most of the fears will be
unwarranted, if they can’t be immediately dismissed, their long-term effect on
our democracy can be just as damaging as actual election fraud.</p>]]></content><author><name>Richard Morrill</name></author><category term="politics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a hotly contested election, accusations of fraud can be just as dangerous as real fraud.

imaginary and otherwise, that I figured out how to do this cool thing and that
they should do it, and then saying I’ll write a post about it one day, I’m

I’ll actually write about all the cool and pointless LaTeX tricks I’ve been

empty until I mature enough that it’s definitely embarrassing, and I delete it
completely.</p>

<p>My goals with this are to share all the weird tricks I’ve had to come up with by
splicing together multitudes of StackOverflow solutions, make myself sound at
least 3% more credible, and maybe make the 0.01% of people that like my humor
laugh.  At this point, all the post ideas I have so far are based around one or
more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How annoying C++ is sometimes</li>
  <li>LaTeX tricks designed to defeat your professor’s margin-measuring,
and allow you to turn in that 3 page paper and meet a 5 page minimum.</li>
  <li>Pointless and weird projects involving hardware I get from the trash</li>
  <li>Stuff I wish somebody had told me like 4 years ago</li>
  <li>Really low-quality Minecraft content</li>
