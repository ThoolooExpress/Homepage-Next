When I was in 10th grade and had
just moved to Cameroon I was alone<sup id="fnref:where-was-stepdad" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:where-was-stepdad" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in a mostly-empty house
while my father went to work, with no internet and no cell service. I was in a country
where I knew nobody, and in which I did not feel safe exploring alone on
foot<sup id="fnref:safe-cameroon" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:safe-cameroon" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. School hadn’t started yet, and I didn’t have a job. There
as simply nothing to do, and the little scraps of entertainment I was able to
find have since faded into the trauma-induced blur that hovers over that week.</p>

<p>A few years later I started having arguably worse weeks due to sickness, injury
and breakups, but even now that week in Cameroon stands out as uniquely
horrifying. For a while I was convinced that the scariest part of that week was
how nearly all of the discomfort I felt came from within, from my own inability
to not become horribly depressed in the absence of external stimulation, or to
seek out entertainment that wasn’t spoon-fed by social media algorithms. I did
have access to pen and paper, a large yard and a pool, none of which I used to
their full potential to either entertain myself or do anything remotely
self-improving.</p>

<p>The thing is, despite handling that week pretty badly, I survived. School
started, we got internet, I got a local SIM card and I mostly forgot about the
hours I spent pacing around becoming increasingly frustrated with my inability
to find anything to do. What really scares me when I think about that week now
is just how much worse it would be if I were stuck in a similar situation today.</p>

<p>Like many wanna-be sigma males my age, I’ve attempted to break my content
addiction and been both amazed and horrified by the lengths my lizard brain will
go to get its “fix.” A while back I removed all social media apps from my phone
and very quickly found myself aggressively scrolling back through promotional
emails while on the toilet. I told myself I was only going to watch
“educational” YouTube videos, and very quickly found myself drawn to endless
lists of facts that bombard the mind with far more information than it can
possibly absorb in a single sitting, even taking into account my incredible
ability to memorize obscure and useless information. There’s some part of my
brain that just needs that shotgun blast of new information, whether it
comes from thirst traps on Instagram, Reddit comments, or Youtube videos. On the
few occasions that I’ve tried to cut out the filler content cold turkey I’ve
been able to feel my mood worsening with every instance my mind has craved
content and I’ve denied it.</p>

<p>So, with this more recent experience in mind, I’m actually pretty proud of how I
handled that week in Cameroon. I was a little depressed, sure, but mostly I just
accepted the boredom as a temporary fact of life and knew I’d get through it. I
wish I could handle attempting to quit filling my empty moments with short-form
content nearly as gracefully. Despite mostly failing to do anything meaningful
that week, I do recall engaging in a few extended periods of deep thought that
ended up significantly changing how I saw myself and approached socializing in
my new school. Now when I end up with a day with nothing to do I almost always
lose it to content consumption. Sometimes I wish I could just spend a day being
bored.</p>

about it. In the original version of it I challenged myself to write a post

real fraud.  Observe the behavior of developing-world despots for long enough
and you will see, if you can’t change the results of an election, the next best
thing is to convince everybody that they cannot trust its results.
<!--more-->It’s all too easy to get hung up on whether or not a new form of
voting like vote-by-mail, or electronic voting machines is “safe,” and overlook
the ways that a corrupt politician desperately clinging to power could convince
the public that their opponent committed election fraud.  In this post, I’m
going to briefly look at some of the issues with vote-by-mail, but my primary
focus is going to be on whether it <em>will be trusted</em> not if it <em>can be trusted</em>.
Even if you and I do our research, and decide to entrust your vote to the postal
system, if enough of the rest of the country decides they cannot, it will be
child’s play for Trump (or another politician down the line), to convince them
that their loss was fraudulent.</p>

<p>Vote-by-mail is simply not as easy to trust as a traditional in-person system.
In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI">excellent argument against online
voting</a>, Tom Scott lays out the
primary goals of any voting system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anonymity: Nobody can see how you voted, and once a ballot is cast, voters
have no way to prove who they voted for.</li>
  <li>Trust: It must be extremely difficult to create fake votes or prevent
legitimate votes from being counted, and everybody with a stake in the
election must trust the system enough to believe its results.</li>
</ul>

<p>A traditional paper ballot system accomplishes this by having every voter place
a ballot (which must not contain any individually identifiable marks) into a
tamper-evident ballot box, which is only opened for counting in the presence of
a member of every party involved in the election.  Although there are plenty of
attacks that can be made against this system, in Tom’s words they, “do not scale
well,” as almost every conceivable attack involves manipulating people, not
technology, and would need to be repeated for every opposition party
representative at every place that votes are counted.  Trust in the system is
achieved through an utter lack of trust in any individual.  At every stage, the
voter is the only person ever allowed to be alone with a ballot, and even then,
only inside the controlled environment of a voting booth.  Importantly, every
voter can readily understand why this form of security is effective.</p>

<p>When you cast a ballot by mail, however, numerous individuals, primarily in the
postal system, have time alone with your ballot to read, modify, or destroy it.
Although the final counting procedure ends up being fairly similar to in an
in-person election, how can you trust that your ballot actually made it into the
pile?  Also, what’s to stop voters from showing their ballot to others before
sending it off, thus proving who their voted for, to potentially receive a
financial reward, or to avoid threatened violence?</p>

<p>I’ve only scratched the surface of holes that can be poked in vote-by-mail. Some
of these issues can be at least partially resolved with tamper-evident
envelopes, special anonymous confirmation codes, and other band-aid solutions.
However, the issue here is largely the same one that would arise if I were to
create, using my knowledge of cryptography, a “mathematically perfect”
public-key-based voting system.  I could trust it, anybody with a background in
mathematics or computer science could trust it, but could hundreds of millions
of technophobic and poorly-educated voters trust it?  Everybody understands that
it’s hard to tamper with a box of ballots if you’re being observed from every
angle by people who are unlikely to conspire together due to their opposing
political interests.  Every change you make to the existing system invites new
theories about how it can be defrauded.  Although most of the fears will be
unwarranted, if they can’t be immediately dismissed, their long-term effect on
our democracy can be just as damaging as actual election fraud.</p>]]></content><author><name>Richard Morrill</name></author><category term="politics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a hotly contested election, accusations of fraud can be just as dangerous as real fraud.

imaginary and otherwise, that I figured out how to do this cool thing and that
they should do it, and then saying I’ll write a post about it one day, I’m
actually doing it. I finally made a blog! <!--more--> Only time will tell if
I’ll actually write about all the cool and pointless LaTeX tricks I’ve been
using to meet page-minimums, and all the weird and horrible stuff I do to all my
VsCode installations because I’m way too picky, or if I’ll just leave this blog
empty until I mature enough that it’s definitely embarrassing, and I delete it
completely.</p>

<p>My goals with this are to share all the weird tricks I’ve had to come up with by
splicing together multitudes of StackOverflow solutions, make myself sound at
least 3% more credible, and maybe make the 0.01% of people that like my humor
laugh.  At this point, all the post ideas I have so far are based around one or
more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How annoying C++ is sometimes</li>
  <li>LaTeX tricks designed to defeat your professor’s margin-measuring,
and allow you to turn in that 3 page paper and meet a 5 page minimum.</li>
  <li>Pointless and weird projects involving hardware I get from the trash</li>
  <li>Stuff I wish somebody had told me like 4 years ago</li>
  <li>Really low-quality Minecraft content</li>
</ul>

<p>Check back in about 5 years, maybe I’ll have remembered that this exists and
actually made another post.</p>]]></content><author><name>Richard Morrill</name></author><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shocking, isn’t it, after a literal decade of constantly telling my friends, imaginary and otherwise, that I figured out how to do this cool thing and that they should do it, and then saying I’ll write a post about it one day, I’m actually doing it.
