[HOARD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/63000/HOARD/) is a uniquley brilliant
cross between a top-down shooter and a real-time strategy game that I got on
Humble Bundle a very long time ago and forgot about. Judging by the difficulty
I've had finding an online match, it seems like everybody else has forgotten
about it as well. It's time to bring it back.<!--more-->

## Basic mechanics

Fly around, burn stuff, colect gold, don't die. That's really all there is to
get before jumping into your first single-dragon HOARD game. As long as you have
a controller, the controls are as simple as it gets: one stick to fly around,
another to aim your fire breath, and a handful of buttons to perform
less-frequent actions like buying skills and activating power-ups. There is no
mental geometry to be performed either, as the direction you push your analogue
sticks will always line up with the direction actions happen on screen. The only
thing it takes any real effort to wrap your head around is that you can't move
and breathe fire at the same time.
