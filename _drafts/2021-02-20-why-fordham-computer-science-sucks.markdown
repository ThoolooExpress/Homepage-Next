Fordham's computer science program achieves a rare balancing act in managing to
elicit rage, disappointment, and imposter syndrome from both its most and least
talented students.  <!--more-->Fordham CS lacks the rigor, both on a program
level, and within individual classes[^1] to produce strong junior software
engineers in 4 years, while simultaneously failing to provide a reasonable
introduction to Computer Science for totally inexperienced students. Admittedly,
many of the deficiencies aren't unique to Fordham's program, as education and
job requirements not lining up has plagued the tech industry at large for
decades, and a painless introduction to programming has always been elusive.  However,
Fordham has managed to distinguish itself among
The problem, simply put, is that Fordham's classes don't make you write enough
code, and the code you do write isn't graded nearly as harshly as it ought to
be. This means that while you may learn the specific topics covered by your
computer science classes, you won't develop the practical skills needed to
actually work on large, complex programs without losing your mind.

_This is part of a many-part series on Fordham's computer science department,
its shortcomings, and how a hapless undergrad that just wanted to write code
can succeed despite (probably) applying to the wrong school._

## Scale

Even the largest open-ended projects I was assigned at Fordham ended up being
the scale of a quick-and-dirty demo in the real world.  Many classes that could
have benefitted greatly from more coding didn't even have any significant
projects. I'll give credit where credit is due, though, in a few classes, such
as Data Structures, and Operating Systems, most of the projects we did were
laser-focused on the content of the syllabus, and did a great job enhancing our
practical understanding of the material being taught[^2].  However, even in the
classes which did the best at enhancing their theoretical content with practical
examples, we missed out on an opportunity to gradually build up our software
engineering toolbox by being limited to small, relatively short-lived projects.

Blah Blah Test Test

[^1]: Shoutout to Weiss, Trovato, Kounavelis, and Tsadok, sorry you got dragged into this.
[^2]: These are exceptions, not the rule.  In classes such as Database Systems, the projects really diverged
      quite egregiously from the content we saw on exams.
