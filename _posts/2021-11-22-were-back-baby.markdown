As of noon on November 22nd 2021, for no particular reason but boredom, I'm challenging myself to
write 5 blog posts over the next 4 weeks. This should line up pretty niceley with when I stop
giving a shit about everything because it's the holidays and nobody ever does anything. If I fail
this challenge, I have to delete this blog, and replace it with a static landing page admitting
that I simply am incapable of generating content.
