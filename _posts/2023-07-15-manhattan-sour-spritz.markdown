Earlier today I was kinda hot from making the critical mistake of walking around
in New York in the summer, so naturally the first thing I wanted to do when I
got home was get my buzz on. Normally I'd reach for a light beer, but all I had
in my fridge was Leffe, so I had to improvise. I'd left a bottle of Wild Turkey
front and center on my liquor cart, and instantly both a Manhattan and a Whiskey
sour were front and center on my mind.<!--more-->However, I wanted something at
least a little hydrating, so I got the wonderful idea to mix most of the
ingredients from both together and spritz it up a bit.

## WTF, is this a cooking blog now?

Given how little I post, I wouldn't call this an *anything* blog. It's just
where I ramble about whatever's on my mind every few months or so. I do intend
to make a bit more cooking / cocktail content at some point, but notice the
distinct lack of a lengthy backstory or photos on this post\&emdash;I plan on
keeping anything culinary-adjacent strictly limited to recipes and results of
experiments.

## Recipe {#recipe}

### Ingredients

*   1.5oz Wild Turkey bourbon

*   1oz sweet vermouth

*   2tbsp granulated sugar (or 3-tips of one of those controlled-pour sugar
    server thingies, I didn't actually measure)

*   1tbsp fresh lemon juice (or however much comes out of 1/2 a lemon, I didn't
    actually measure)

*   seltzer water (prefer SodaStream or other highly-carbonated water; if you
    use something like S. Pellegrino that's actually pleasant to drink plain,
    the final drink will be under-carbonated)

*   bitters

### Instructions

1.  Prepare the glass: Add a few cubes of ice to a 12-oz glass (I used the
    conical Ikea ones that are ribbed for your pleasure. I have no idea what that
    kind of glass is actually called, it's kind of like the "shaker pint" bad
    bars serve draft beers in but 12oz instead of 16.)

2.  Add the vermouth to the bottom of the glass.

3.  Shake the bourbon, sugar and lemon juice very hard. (Don't worry too much if
    there's a little bit of sugar left in the bottom of the shaker; I sure as
    hell didn't.)

4.  Strain the contents of the shaker gently into the glass, taking care to
    maintain a bit of a "sunrise" effect with the sweet vermouth, if you actually
    care about that kind of stuff.

5.  Top with seltzer, and carefully incorporate the shaken ingredients with the
    seltzer with a bar spoon, taking care to avoid disturbing the layer of sweet
    vermouth on the bottom.

6.  Dribble some bitters on top in whatever artful pattern suits your fancy (but
    it better be a dick.)

7.  Forget to take a picture.

8.  Decide not having pictures in your posts is your thing now.

9.  Make 3 more, get a bit of a buzz on.

10. Decide today is the day to revive your blog you've been ignoring for months.
