I thought I knew the worst week of my life. When I was in 10th grade and had
just moved to Cameroon I was alone[^where-was-stepdad] in a mostly-empty house
while my father went to work, with no internet and no cell service. I was in a country
where I knew nobody, and in which I did not feel safe exploring alone on
foot[^safe-cameroon]. School hadn't started yet, and I didn't have a job. There
as simply nothing to do, and the little scraps of entertainment I was able to
find have since faded into the trauma-induced blur that hovers over that week.

[^where-was-stepdad]:
    There is one issue with this story: my stepfather was
    there as well, and was not working at that point. I honestly cannot recall
    whether he was there but we simply did not have much to talk about, or if he was
    off doing something I've forgotten about. He had only been married to my
    father for a short while at that point, and I recall that we didn't exactly
    hit it off when we first started living together, so it's possible we just
    ignored each other.

[^safe-cameroon]:
    I want to be clear, at least when I was there from 2013 to
    2016, my neighborhood, Bastos, Yaound√© was not particularly unsafe, and
    later on I felt perfectly safe to walk to nearby stores and friends' houses.

A few years later I started having arguably worse weeks due to sickness, injury
and breakups, but even now that week in Cameroon stands out as uniquely
horrifying. For a while I was convinced that the scariest part of that week was
how nearly all of the discomfort I felt came from within, from my own inability
to not become horribly depressed in the absence of external stimulation, or to
seek out entertainment that wasn't spoon-fed by social media algorithms. I did
have access to pen and paper, a large yard and a pool, none of which I used to
their full potential to either entertain myself or do anything remotely
self-improving.

The thing is, despite handling that week pretty badly, I survived. School
started, we got internet, I got a local SIM card and I mostly forgot about the
hours I spent pacing around becoming increasingly frustrated with my inability
to find anything to do. What really scares me when I think about that week now
is just how much worse it would be if I were stuck in a similar situation today.

Like many wanna-be sigma males my age, I've attempted to break my content
addiction and been both amazed and horrified by the lengths my lizard brain will
go to get its "fix." A while back I removed all social media apps from my phone
and very quickly found myself aggressively scrolling back through promotional
emails while on the toilet. I told myself I was only going to watch
"educational" YouTube videos, and very quickly found myself drawn to endless
lists of facts that bombard the mind with far more information than it can
possibly absorb in a single sitting, even taking into account my incredible
ability to memorize obscure and useless information. There's some part of my
brain that just needs that shotgun blast of new information, whether it
comes from thirst traps on Instagram, Reddit comments, or Youtube videos. On the
few occasions that I've tried to cut out the filler content cold turkey I've
been able to feel my mood worsening with every instance my mind has craved
content and I've denied it.

So, with this more recent experience in mind, I'm actually pretty proud of how I
handled that week in Cameroon. I was a little depressed, sure, but mostly I just
accepted the boredom as a temporary fact of life and knew I'd get through it. I
wish I could handle attempting to quit filling my empty moments with short-form
content nearly as gracefully. Despite mostly failing to do anything meaningful
that week, I do recall engaging in a few extended periods of deep thought that
ended up significantly changing how I saw myself and approached socializing in
my new school. Now when I end up with a day with nothing to do I almost always
lose it to content consumption. Sometimes I wish I could just spend a day being
bored.
