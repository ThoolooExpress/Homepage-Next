Shocking, isn't it, after a literal decade of constantly telling my friends,
imaginary and otherwise, that I figured out how to do this cool thing and that
they should do it, and then saying I'll write a post about it one day, I'm
actually doing it. I finally made a blog! <!--more--> Only time will tell if
I'll actually write about all the cool and pointless LaTeX tricks I've been
using to meet page-minimums, and all the weird and horrible stuff I do to all my
VsCode installations because I'm way too picky, or if I'll just leave this blog
empty until I mature enough that it's definitely embarrassing, and I delete it
completely.

My goals with this are to share all the weird tricks I've had to come up with by
splicing together multitudes of StackOverflow solutions, make myself sound at
least 3% more credible, and maybe make the 0.01% of people that like my humor
laugh.  At this point, all the post ideas I have so far are based around one or
more of the following:

- How annoying C++ is sometimes
- LaTeX tricks designed to defeat your professor's margin-measuring,
  and allow you to turn in that 3 page paper and meet a 5 page minimum.
- Pointless and weird projects involving hardware I get from the trash
- Stuff I wish somebody had told me like 4 years ago
- Really low-quality Minecraft content

Check back in about 5 years, maybe I'll have remembered that this exists and
actually made another post.
