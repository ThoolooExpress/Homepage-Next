The Coinbase One Card has the potential to be a cashback king, but the devil is
in the details. 4% cashback sounds great until you realize that getting there
requires having $200k in your Coinbase account, and that the card won't work
with your budgeting app. This card could make sense, but only for a very
specific type of user. All users are likely to complain about the fact that the
only way to access live transaction data for this card is through the Coinbase
app, and that it is not compatible with any budgeting apps.

*This review is based on my personal experience and publicly available
information as of 2025-11-16. Terms and conditions may change, and your results
may vary. Before making a decision on this card, read the latest version of the
card's official terms and conditions. This review is not financial advice.
Consult with a qualified professional before making any investment decisions.*

have missed some points you'd expect to be covered or made some errors in my
analysis. I welcome any and all feedback, contact info at the bottom of every

issuing bank
: First Electronic Bank (via Cardless)

## The budgeting app problem

I've used a few cards that didn't play nicely with my budgeting apps, but that
generally just meant that I had to frequently re-authenticate, or that the data
came in slowly. Even cards issued by legacy banks with wretched apps and
websites would give up their data if I was willing to hand over my password to
Plaid or a similar data broker. Not so with the Coinbase One Card.

The only way to get live transaction data is through the Coinbase app. The card
simply does not show up in the APIs that Coinbase exposes to budgeting apps.
There is no website that can be scraped. There also is no "back door" access to
your account through the Amex app, First Electronic Bank (the actual issuing
bank), or Cardless. Cardless actually touts this lack of secondary access as a
feature of their platform, since Coinbase's card customers never leave their
app.

I tested Monarch and Simplifi. Due to the lack of a website and the invisibility
of this card in Coinbase's API, I highly doubt any other apps would work, but
YMMV. I am fairly hopeful Coinbase / Cardless will address this issue soon,
because I highly suspect there is significant overlap between the audience for
this card and the audience for budgeting apps, but as it is right now this is a
massive feature gap that makes this card hard to recommend.

## Break-even math

I'll cut right to the chase: You're probably not breaking even on this card
unless you're a crypto enthusiast.

The Coinbase One Card might look like a fairly straightforward cashback card,
but since it's so heavily tied to the Coinbase ecosystem, we can't really assess
the card's value in a vacuum. Your annual fee is your Coinbase One membership,
which you must maintain as long as you hold the card. Currently, the lowest tier
is $49.99.

For most users, getting positive value out of this card will depend on both
maximizing the value of the Coinbase One membership itself and earning cashback
on the card. However, exactly how much value you get from each side is highly
dependent on your personal situation.

### Cashback

First, let's look at what it would take to break-even on cashback only. The cash
back tiers are as follows (based on the total value of your crypto and USDC
holdings with Coinbase):

- $0-10k: 2%
- $10k-50k: 2.5%
- $50k-200k: 3%
- $200k+: 4%

However, looking at the rates in a vacuum is misleading, because you can get 2%
cashback from many different no-annual-fee cards. So really we should be looking
at how much more you could be earning compared to a 2% card you probably already
have in your wallet:

- $0-10k: 0%
- $10k-50k: 0.5%
- $50k-200k: 1%
- $200k+: 2%

If you only consider cashback, the break-even spend is:

- $0-10k: ∞
- $10k-50k: $9998
- $50k-200k: $4999
- $200k+: $2499.50

So, based on cashback alone, you the break-even spend doesn't even start to be
reasonable until you have $50k in your Coinbase account. However, there is
significant value to be harvested from the Coinbase One membership itself, so
not all doom and gloom if your Coinbase balance is under $50k.

### Coinbase One

The list of Coinbase One benefits looks long, but a lot of them are quite niche
and tough to put a price to. You might be able to get more value out of your
membership than my analysis can reflect, but to keep things simple I'm only
looking at the following:

- 4% APY on USDC
- no transaction fees on $500 of crypto transactions per month
- 5% staking rewards boost[^staking-rate-1]

[^staking-rate-1]: Multiplying percentages by percentages together always confuses
    people, so let me spell this one out really clearly: If your crypto earns 1%
    APR as its base staking rate, after the boost it will earn 1.05%.

It's really hard to make general statements about the last 2, because they're so
dependent on how you trade and which coins you hold[^staking-rate-2]. They can
definitely both have value, but you need to look at your own holdings and
trading patterns to see what that value would be to you. The USDC APY boost is
significantly easier to value, though:

[^staking-rate-2]: E.g., if you hold a crypto that earns 5% APR as its base
    rate, after the boost it will earn 5.25%. Compare this to the previous
    example to understand how much the base staking APR affects the value of
    this benefit, but also just how tiny it actually is even for an
    unrealistically high-yield crypto.

#### USDC APY boost

The 4% APY on USDC is competitive with most money-market funds and easily beats
most savings accounts. The only way I can think of to beat that rate with
comparable risk and liquidity would be to take advantage of HYSA promotional
offers, but that's not a fair comparison, since typically doing so requires
uncomfortable rearranging of your financial life, and they often don't last all
that long.

As with cashback above, we must compare the rates we get to a free and easily
accessible benchmark in order to find the real value. If we take Fidelity's
SPAXX as a benchmark, its last 7 day yield was 3.60% (as of 2025-11-13), giving
us a real value of just 0.4%. This gives a break-even balance of $12,497.50.

How reasonable this number sounds to you is highly dependent on how much you
trust stablecoins. For a non-crypto investor, the idea of moving that much money
from an FDIC-insured bank account and into Coinbase just to take advantage of a
cashback credit card would probably sound ridiculous. I suspect a lot of crypto
enthusiasts would rather have their money in something more exciting than USDC.
If you're somewhere in the middle, and already have sufficient emergency funds
in FDIC-ensured accounts or similarly secure instruments, maybe throwing some
cash into your Coinbase account makes sense.

I can't tell you how much you should keep in USDC, but if you're going to hold
USDC one way or another, Coinbase One can probably give you some value.

### Combined break-even example

When you put the two sides of this card's value proposition together, it starts
to make more and more sense for smaller crypto holders and smaller spenders.
There are a lot of ways this could play out, but just as an example, let's
consider the following cardholder:

- Annual Spend: $5k
- Holdings: $8k USDC, $2k staked crypto at average base APR 3.5%
- Trading: Buy $500 in various crypto monthly[^ignoring-staking]

[^ignoring-staking]: Note that I'm ignoring any staking rewards from this
    newly-purchased crypto to keep the math simple.

This user would earn $125 in total cashback, or $25 in cashback over a free 2%
card.

They'd earn $320 in USDC interest, or $32 over SPAXX.

The staking APR boost is basically worthless in this scenario, coming in at a
whopping $0.35 in value.

It's hard to estimate what their trading fees would
have been, given how variable Coinbase's fee structure can be, but to be
conservative let's say they're only paying the 0.6% maker fee on the advanced
trading view, bringing their savings to $36 dollars for the year.

So this gives a grand total of $93 in value, easily offsetting the $49.99 annual
fee, although probably not by enough to be worth diverting spending from more
lucrative points-based cards. Still, it's not nothing, and most people in this
card's target audience probably have considerably larger crypto holdings, and
might be able to better take advantage of the more fringe Coinbase One benefits
for some additional value.

## Minor considerations

### Amex network

This card comes with the main drawback of an Amex card, that is, being on the
Amex network, without having the benefit of Amex's great customer service, since
everything flows through Coinbase. That said, you do get some benefit from being
on the Amex network:

- Retail Protection[^not-plat]
- Extended Warranty
- Return Protection
- Amex Offers
- Amex Experiences™
- Worldwide Car Rental Loss & Damage Insurance
- Trip Cancellation/Trip Interruption
- Lost or Damaged Luggage Insurance
- Roadside Assistance
- Emergency Assistance

[^not-plat]: Note that this is the more basic coverage present on lower-tier
    Amex cards, not the Platinum's enhanced benefit.

I don't rate the value of these super highly, and I have other Amex cards that
offer the same benefits. If you don't have another Amex card they might have
more value to you.

### Physical card

The physical card itself looks and feels great, if you like a nice heavy metal
card. I do wish they'd dropped the tap-to-pay so the card could clank. The
genesis block text on the front is crisp, and the satin texture looks great in
most lighting conditions. Overall I'd say it feels premium and looks exactly
like Coinbase's pictures.

## Conclusion

There isn't much to this card beyond the dollars and cents it can earn you, and
earning those dollars and cents relies on you being deeply embedded into
Coinbase's ecosystem. I really question how big the actual market for this card
could be, considering that any prospective holder would need to both have enough
crypto to gain positive value, but not be such a crypto enthusiast that they
refuse to use custodial wallets.

My opinion of this card fluctuated wildly as I was putting together this review.
On one hand, it is nice to see a proper crypto-based premium credit card
offering, but on the other, it has a glaring flaw in its budgeting app
incompatibility. For me personally, it does work in my wallet as a catch-all to
backstop my category-based cards, but the rewards aren't juicy enough to divert
any of my category spending.

If you're going to subscribe to Coinbase One one way or another, then the card
is a nice freebie, but it's probably not worth shifting assets into Coinbase
just to take advantage of this card.
