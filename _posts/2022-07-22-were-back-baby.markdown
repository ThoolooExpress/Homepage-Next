Fun fact... if you check the
[README.md](https://github.com/ThoolooExpress/Homepage-Next#readme) from this
site's repo you'll notice that it's necessary to run a command to actually build
the site on every commit<!--more--> since I disabled automatic Jekyll
integration because Github Pages is using an extremely outdated version of
Jekyll. Well I didn't do that...

Anyways, it's just as well because the post I mentioned in the original version
of this post ended up being a rabbit hole to write and I gave up on it.

Fun fact... this post was supposed to go live literally months ago and I forgot
about it. In the original version of it I challenged myself to write a post
every week for 5 weeks, and failed miserably. There's no challenge this time, 
but I do have one solitary post in the works.
