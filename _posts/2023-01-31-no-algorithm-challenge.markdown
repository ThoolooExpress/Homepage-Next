I am issuing a challenge to myself and anybody else who is interested: For one
week, avoid all forms of entertainment based around recommendation algorithms.
<!--more--> This is partially a follow-up to
[last week's post]({% link _posts/2023-01-25-boredom-tolerance.markdown %}), but
I decided to make the rules quite a bit
stricter and shorten the time frame after reading about
[The One Week Command Line Challenge](https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/cmdline-challenge.html).
(Thanks, [@focaccio](https://defcon.social/@focaccio) for bringing that article
to my attention.)

## Why?

Originally, taking a break from algorithm-recommended content was simply a way
to break my addiction to a contant drip of spoon-fed short-form content. I
wanted to be come more okay with simply not being optimally entertained every
waking second of my life. However, the second reason given for *The Command Line
Challenge* really stuck with me:

> I believe too few of us are concerned with living productive lives. This is
> not just about our productive use of technology. Many seem not to be concerned
> with being productive as human beings.

I often am concerned with how little of my life outside of work is anything
close to productive. The article goes on to hit even closer to home:

> Out of apathy, many of us are allowing ourselves to be nothing more than
> worker drones with little if any individuality, intellectual curiosity, or
> goals in life other than following the lemmings ahead of us in our swift race
> through life that leads ultimately only to our deaths.

I realized that my media habits have a second dark side: it's very rare that I
make an informed, independent decision about what I do with my free time. I will
spend an entire Saturday drinking from the algorithm-powered firehoses of Youtube
and Reddit and then wonder as I'm waiting to fall asleep why I didn't choose to
write a blog post or work on any of my personal projects. Now I've realized that
the issue isn't that I was *choosing* not to be productive, it's that I wasn't
*choosing* anything at all! I spent the entire day stuffed so full of
fresh content that there was no room left in my mind to make a conscious choice
about anything.

Using only a command line on my computer and disabling every non-messaging app
on my phone would definitley prevent me from binging short-form content. The
problem is that the Command Line Challenge itself just isn't appealing to me. Don't
get me wrong, I use a command line extensivley every day both at work and at
home, and am reasonably competent at it, but the idea of checking my email and
responding to code review comments through a terminal interface has absolutley
zero appeal to me. Some things really are best done through a GUI.

So, my goal here is twofold: I want to leave a little more boredom in my day and
I want to replace my habit of mindlessly consuming content with a habit of
making a conscious choice about what content I consume and how I entertain
myself.

I'm under no dilusion that I'll be able to make every second of my life
productive. Some lesure time and entertainment will always be necessary.
However, I believe that if I can at least restore some real decisions to my
daily routine I'll choose to be productive more often.

## Rules

There really is only one rule:

**Decide what you want to do before you start doing it.**

How you choose to implement this needs to be a personal decision, because
everybody has different tastes in entertainment and different hobbies, and so
will need to implement a different set of detailed rules. Here is my plan for
living a bit more intentionally:

1. Block feeds and recommendations on Reddit and Youtube. Those two sites are
   such indispensible repositories of useful information that totally excluding
   them from my Google search results would hamper my abliity to look up how to
   do anything. However, I can block the most insidious parts of both sites with
   uBlock Origin. (I'll post a follow-up with the filters I end up using.)

2. Avoid almost all traditional social media sites like the bird app and
   Instagram altogether.

2. Limit my use of Mastodon to my home feed. I only recently started
   using Mastodon, so my follow list has not gotten too poluted. At this point
   every follow has been a distinct choice that still reflects my current
   preferences fairly well, so I don't see anything wrong with reading posts
   from the peolpe I've subscribed to. Since I don't follow too many people yet
   there are only so many posts to read every day. I will be keeping track of my
   usage and consider excluding Mastodon entireley in future iterations of the
   challenge if I sink too much time into it.

3. Limit my consumption of traditional broadcast TV to live sports. I think my
   reasons for avoiding channel-surfing shows on traditional TV are pretty self
   explanatory, but I think it's okay to make a carve-out for sports since
   the self-limiting factor of there only being so many games on I want to
   watch in any given week.

6. Hide comments on [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org). I need some tech news, and
   Mastodon isn't quite doing it for me. The articles on Slashdot's front page
   are of highly-variable quality, but there are only so many of them every day,
   so it isn't an endless content stream. The comments, however, are an
   oppurtunity to doomscroll I can do without.

7. Avoid Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other subscription streaming sites.
   Theoretically I could still consume from these sites without violating the
   spirit of this challenge by just deciding what to watch before opening the
   site / app, but I spend too  much time using them and figured this would be
   a good opportunity to explore other froms of entertainment.

Of course, you can't break habits, only form new ones. I don't have a super
concrete plan for what I'm going to replace mindless content creation with, but
here are some of my ideas:

*  Play the games that I already own. My entire Steam backlog is made up of hopeful
   conscious choices that I later ignored in favor of drinking from the
   algorithms' teats for hours on end. Maybe I'll make some progress trying out
   all those forlorn indie games I've got kicking around. (Not too hopeful for
   that one.)

*  Read the books I already own. Reasoning is the same as above.

*  Most importantly of all: **create content**. I'm not entireley sure
   what I'll create. Maybe it'll be more blog posts here. Maybe I'll write a
   short story. I'll probably make a few open source contributions as well, but
   my goal here really isn't to force myself to code outside work.

If you're considering this challenge, you should probably include "go outside"
as part of your plan. My plan doesn't include that because right now I can't do
much outside as I just had knee surgery.

## What now?

I'll annouce the start of my personal challenge on Mastodon, post daily updates
there, and then write a conclusion article here. I want to go Monday to Sunday,
so if nothing changes, I'll start next Monday, Febuary 6th. I'll be using
#noalgorithmchallenge for all posts relating to this challenge, and I suggest
you do the same if you'd like to take this challenge yourself and document your
experience publicly.
