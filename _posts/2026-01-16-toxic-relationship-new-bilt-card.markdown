Congratulations, Bilt, you've managed to make me feel more distinct emotions in
the 15-ish hours since I learned the [full terms of your new
cards](https://newsroom.biltrewards.com/meetbiltcard2.0) than I've felt about a
credit card, ever.<!--more--> I always knew the new cards would be a harder sell
than the old one, given that Wells Fargo was no longer hemorrhaging millions
every month to subsidize our lavish rewards[^wsj-bilt-wells]. What I really did
not anticipate was just how masterful of a job Bilt would do at structuring
their terms to be absolute <del>catnip</del>_crack_ for credit card nerds.

The value is tantalizing, but a lot of it is locked behind a strange secondary
rewards currency with terms that are quite unlike anything we currently see on
the market. Deciding whether or not any of these cards are for you is more than
a simple financial calculation: it requires unpacking exactly what you hope to
get out of your credit cards in terms of the overall experience and lifestyle
and possibly relegating some old favorites from your daily spend lineup.

[^wsj-bilt-wells]: AnnaMaria Androitis and Gina Heeb, "Wells Fargo Bet on a
    Flashy Rent Credit Card. It Is Costing the Bank Dearly," _Wall Street
    Journal_, June 16, 2024,

Before we get into this, no, I'm not going to give you a straight answer on
whether or not you should get any of the new Bilt Cards. For reasons I'm about
to get into, there probably is not a straight answer to be had, but there is
already a [great calculator](https://diyfi.co/#/tools/is-bilt-worth-it) out that
should help you decide, at least if dollars and cents are your only
concern[^annual-fees]. Instead, I'm going to unpack and appreciate just how
great a job Bilt has done at providing _just_ enough value to keep us
interested, sidelining unprofitable customers, and crafting a rewards program so
fresh and nuanced that one has to wonder if it's all an elaborate marketing
puzzle to force us to talk about the card more.

[^annual-fees]: I'm also not going to discuss the annual fees on the higher-end
    cards in depth, as all of them can easily be recouped via statement credits
    that aren't connected to the broader Bilt rewards system. I get that some
    people oppose annual fees on principle, but most cardheads that are already
    in the Amex or Chase ecosystems will find the break-even math refreshingly
    simple.

## The basics

Let me lead with something nice: you can now earn points on mortgage payments.

Okay now onto the things that have gotten worse. Note that I'm going to explain
the rewards system in the way that makes most sense to me, now. It might sound
straightforward enough the way I've presented it, but it took me and the people
I worked it out with a rather frustrating series of messages back and forth to
work it out.

Using your card 5 times per month for something cheap like subway taps or
vending machines is no longer enough to unlock points for rent. Instead, you
need to pay a 3% fee to unlock the ability to earn 1 point/$ on your housing
payment[^interchange-fee]. However, it's not expected that most people will pay
this fee in cash. Instead, most people will pay this fee with a new rewards
currency that the new cards earn in addition to points, Bilt Cash. If you don't
have enough Bilt Cash, you can choose to either pay part of the fee to receive
part of the points, or to pay the fee in cash[^different-explanations].

[^interchange-fee]: Let me settle some confusion I've seen around this fee: this
    is totally unrelated to any sort of fees your landlord might charge you for
    paying rent with a credit card. The actual transaction costs whatever it did
    on the old Bilt card, usually zero since most people pay by ACH or check.
    The 3% fee is just to unlock the ability to earn points on the transaction.

[^different-explanations]: If you read Bilt's announcement you probably noticed
    that they describe this whole system very differently than the way I'm
    describing it here, but I assure you, financially it works out to be
    equivalent to the way I've described it. Bilt seems to be trying to draw our
    attention towards unlocking points and away from paying fees.

All the new Bilt cards earn 4% cash back in Bilt Cash. Exactly what Bilt Cash is
worth outside of unlocking points for housing payments remains to be seen, but
it seems that it can be spent at select businesses, and that those businesses
will generally be outside the categories where you'd normally spend Bilt Points.
If you do put Bilt Cash towards unlocking points, every $3 unlocks 100 bilt
points. When you crunch all the numbers, this means that up to a spend of 75% of
your housing payment, the 4% cash back in Bilt Cash is worth 1.33 points/$.

## The emotional roller coaster

First it was dread. I loved the old Bilt Card, even more so when I learned just
how much Wells Fargo was losing on it. Sure, it had its annoyances, like the
need to use Wells Fargo's online portal from time to time, but overall it was by
far my favorite no-annual-fee dining card, with an added freebie from the points
for rent[^rent-points]. So, as soon as I saw that first survey Bilt sent around
asking us to consider 3 potential options that sounded a whole lot like
something Chase would put out, I knew what was coming. The Bilt I knew, and I
was not looking forward to its replacement.

[^rent-points]: I think a lot of people got too caught up in points for rent and
    really slept on the value the original Bilt Card had as a dining card. Yeah,
    the Amex Gold could out-earn it, but the annual fee math won't work out for
    everybody. Bilt's transfer partners are also great at filling in the gaps in
    other rewards programs.

Then, it was confusion. I'd expected Bilt to sell me just another trio of points
cards with the points for rent tacked onto all of them. The Bilt Cash points
unlocking mechanic threw me for a loop. Once you get it, it's really not that
complicated, but if all you have to go off of is Bilt's announcement, it's a lot
to take in at once.

As my understanding grew, my confusion quickly turned to anger. I thought, Bilt
did this on purpose, specifically to trick people into thinking they will be
getting more value out of these cards than they actually will. I was absolutely
baffled trying to work out for myself exactly what the "4% back in Bilt Cash"
was actually worth. I knew for damn sure they weren't giving us 4% general cash
back cards.

I spent more time talking Bilt with some fellow cardheads in my company's
personal finance Slack channel, and slowly but surely I actually started to see
how I could get some value out of these new cards. I had hope. I started playing
out exactly how my spending could go, and how many points I could earn. I even
started to consider how amazing of a value these cards could be if Bilt Cash had
any real value outside of unlocking points for rent.

Then the cynicism hit. I realized just how much time I'd been spending just
thinking about how to convert one made-up rewards currency into a different
made-up rewards currency, which at some point in the future could be converted
into a third made-up rewards currency, which would be used to book flights on a
trip that I'm probably only going on because I found an amazing redemption offer
on a specialized flight screener I have to pay a subscription fee to
access[^point-me]. During that trip I'll probably end up spending a great deal
of money on things I can't use points for, but at least I'll get to enjoy a
"free" cocktail in the lounge[^lounges].

[^lounges]: For me it is mostly free, because I don't factor lounge access into
    my break-even math for annual fee cards, and I don't think you should
    either, but lounges are a topic for another day.

[^point-me]: [I use point.me to find good points transfer opportunities, if
    you're interested this is my shameless affiliate
    link.](https://share.point.me/7fhb8m)

## So why do I like credit cards, anyways?

Something about the sheer absurdity of how complicated it is to calculate the
actual return on spend of the new Bilt cards really highlighted just how absurd
the entire credit card ecosystem has become. I did, for a moment, wonder if this
was all just becoming more trouble than it was worth, and if I should even
consider just cancelling my Amex Platinum and giving up on my quest to get the
Ritz Carlton card as well[^ritz-card].

[^ritz-card]: The only way to get it is to hold a different Chase Marriott card
    for 1 year before you can product change into it. Currently have 9 months to
    go holding onto the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless, desperately hoping the Ritz
    card doesn't get nerfed to hell before my time is up. [If you're interested,
    here's yet another shameless referral link, should work for all Chase
    Marriott cards.](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/252t/1LQF8STJH6)

It's quite the coincidence that the Wall Street Journal ran an opinion piece by
Elliot Penn, titled "Life Is Too Short for Frequent-Flyer Miles"[^wsj-miles]
only 2 days before Bilt's big reveal of the new cards. A part of me did want to
draw the same conclusions as Mr. Penn, that the time saved by making slightly
suboptimal financial choices could be better spent elsewhere.

    Street Journal_, January 12, 2026,

The thing is, I like the game. Something about min-maxing just gets me going.
Sometimes an actual video game can scratch that itch, but it's better when I've
got some more skin in the game. Credit card rewards have just enough value that
my decisions have some weight to them, but there's not enough money on the line
for the whole experience to be too stressful.

As Penn wrote, "sometimes it’s optimal to be suboptimal," and for me the optimal
suboptimal is to micro-optimize my credit card loadout, even if my effective
hourly earning rate from the time I spend doing so is less than I could be
earning doing basically anything else. However, the new Bilt Cards are really
pushing things. Figuring this all out is starting to feel dangerously close to
work.

## Conclusions

As I said before, I can't tell you if you should get one of the new Bilt Cards.
I can say, if you have enough patience to get through this long of an article
about credit cards, that's a strong indicator that you might actually have the
patience to get the most out of them. If you do already know you want one and
just want to pick one, my recommendations are as follows:

- Palladium: People that don't have a lounge-access card already, aren't
  afraid of big annual fees, and are willing to put nearly all their spending on
  this one card.

- Obsidian: People that don't have a better dining / grocery card already.

- Blue: People that are terrified of annual fees. This one doesn't have very
  much going for it, but with no annual fee all you stand to lose is the
  opportunity cost of not spending on your other cards.
