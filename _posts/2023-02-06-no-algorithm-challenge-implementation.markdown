Today, I'll be starting on [the challenge I laid out last week]({%- link _posts/2023-01-31-no-algorithm-challenge.markdown -%}),
and to do so I'll
need to put in place some technical safeguards to keep me on track.<!--more-->
I'll be augmenting my self control primarily via focus mode on my phone, browser
extensions, and making sure that I have a full to-do list of both recreational
activities and side projects.

## Phone

Eliminating time spent scrolling on my phone is really the lowest-hanginging
fruit of this entire challenge. I've already mostly migrated away from dedicated
mobile apps, so I'll mostly be using the same browser extensions on Firefox
mobile as I am on desktop. However, I do use Tusky for Mastodon, so I will be
setting up a screen time limit of 30 minutes per day, and hiding every tab
besides my subscription feed. I'll also disable notifications for everything
besides direct messages.

## Browser

This is where the fun begins. For me, spending a week off grid would be taking
this challenge on easy mode. If something interrupts the normal flow of my life,
such as a trip or an old friend staying with me, I can ignore pretty much all of
the electronic distractions in my life for a while and focus on the novelty of
it all. That's not what this challenge is about, though. I want to change my
habits long-term, and for obvious reasons, never using a computer again is just
not an option for me.

So, what I really need to do is strike a balance between my browser being useful
to me and sucking away all my free time. Eventually, I'll have to develop some
self control. However, until I get there, I'll need some browser extennsions to
help me:

- [LeechBlock NG](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/) -
  This one is the heavy hitter. I'm going to use it to restrict my access to a
  huge variety of sites, and limit the total time I can spend on sites that I
  consider necessary, like YouTube and Reddit.

- [Unhook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/) -
  This one will prevent me from using YouTube to do anything but search for specific videos.

- [Reddit Liberation](https://github.com/HZ757/reddit-liberation-extension) - This
  one will allow me to read Reddit comments from Google searches while preventing
  me from getting sucked into my feed. It's actually Chrome only, so making it
  work on Firefox will be one of my first tasks for this week. Until it works,
  I'll totally block Reddit with LeechBlock.

I'll also be making a conscious effort to only check my email when I actually
need to. Sometimes I find scrolling through my junk mail becomes my last-resort
content fix when I try to quit social media, so I'll make it a bit easier to
just not do that by cleaning out my inbox now and trying to unsubscribe / block
as many mailing lists as I can.

## To-Do list

- (As mentioned above) Make Reddit Liberation work on Firefox, and possible
  add a few minor improvements.

- Get good at [5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/).

- Finish *A Crown of Swords* by Robert Jordan.

- Write a short story.
