If you're here because you're thinking of hiring me, 1) you probably don't want to TBH,
and 2) please  note that the rest of this page was created
in like 5 minutes while I was hungover and really shouldn't be considered to be at all
reflective of anything, except perhaps my distinct lack of eloquence, and excellent
self-deprecating humor.

I currently work as a software engineer in New York. Please refrain from asking
me to leak any interview questions and / or proprietary information from work
via email, you'll only embarrass yourself.  If you are trying to get a job as a
software engineer, prepare for your interview using publicly-available
resources, such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

During my senior year at Fordham, I was the research director at the [Fordham
University CS Society](http://fordhamcss.org). If that site looks suspiciously
like this one, it's because when I replaced our old, mostly broken, totally
bloated, bootstrap 2.3 site, I figured I could kill two birds with one stone,
and only customize minima once, basically just changing the color and font
variables.  I should note that I never actually finished that site, and most of
the credit for it should go to my successor, David Bono.

I really hate writing about myself, so here's just a list of random facts to
make this page less empty:

- I really like C#, but I insist on calling it "Microsoft Java" out of principle.
- I honestly can't remember where the hell I got the name ThoolooExpress.
- I sometimes will do non-technical papers in LaTeX because I'm a masochist
- The longest I've lived in the same country is 4 years.
- BTW, I use Arch.

Yay! You survived reading my bio! Now go read my other content, which I _mostly_ actually
give a shit about, and update more than once every 5 years.
