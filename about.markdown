If you're here because you're thinking of hiring me, 1) you probably don't want
to TBH, and 2) please  note that the rest of this page was created in like 5
minutes while I was hungover and really shouldn't be considered to be at all
reflective of anything, except perhaps my distinct lack of eloquence, and
excellent self-deprecating humor.

That last part is not really true anymore, this page has been updated many, many
times since I initially wrote it while hungover in college. I seem to spend
longer and longer on each subsequent revision, and am not nearly as fun at
parties as I used to be, so the chances of me being hungover are lower than they
used to be.

I currently work as a software engineer in New York. Please refrain from asking
me to leak any interview questions and / or proprietary information from work
via email, you'll only embarrass yourself.  If you are trying to get a job as a
software engineer, prepare for your interview using publicly-available
resources, such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

During my senior year at Fordham, I was the research director at the Fordham
University Computer Science Society. There was a beautiful site that I created
for the club, with a lot of help from [David Bono](https://twelventi.com), but
the people that took over the club when we graduated couldn't be bothered to
renew the domain, or even give us their Github usernames so we could transfer
the repo.

I really hate writing about myself, so here's just a list of random facts to
make this page less empty:

- I really like C#, but I insist on calling it "Microsoft Java" out of principle.
- I honestly can't remember what drove me to pick the name "ThoolooExpress". I
  can tell you that I picked it from a randomly-generated list on some
  long-forgotten random name generator site as a new name for my Youtube channel
  when I was in highschool and thought that people would want to watch me play
  Minecraft. The fact that it sounds like HP Lovecraft's monster is purely
  coincidental.
- BTW, I use Arch.

Yay! You survived reading my bio! Now go read my other content, which I _mostly_
actually give a shit about, and update more than once every 5 years.

The above line is preserved from the original version of this bio. Somewhat
ironically, I've actually updated this bio more times than I've posted on this
blog at this point.
