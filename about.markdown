If you're here because you're thinking of hiring me, 1) you probably don't want to TBH,
and 2) please peruse my technical category, and note that the rest of this page was created
in like 5 minutes while I was hungover and really shouldn't be considered to be at all
reflective of anything, except perhaps my distinct lack of eloquence, and excellent
self-deprecating humor.

My current occupation is bored college student.  Occasionally I moonlight
as l33t hax0r or drunk college student.  Maybe one day I'll be a software
engineer IDK man.

I'm the research director at the [Fordham University CS Society](http://fordhamcss.org).
If the site looks suspiciously like this one, it's because when I replaced our old,
mostly broken, totally bloated, bootstrap 2.3 site, I figured I could kill two
birds with one stone, and only customize minima once, basically just changing
the color and font variables.

I really hate writing about myself, so here's just a list of random facts to
make this page less empty:

- I really like C#, but I insist on calling it "Microsoft Java" out of principle
- I honestly can't remember where the hell I got the name ThoolooExpress
- I sometimes will do non-technical papers in LaTeX because I'm a masochist
- The longest I've lived in the same country is 4 years
- BTW, I use Arch

Yay! You survived reading my bio! Now go read my other content, which I _mostly_ actually
give a shit about, and update more than once every 5 years.
